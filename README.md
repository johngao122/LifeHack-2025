# Introduction

EcoLens is a browser extension that analyzes the environmental impact and sustainability of food products and make suggestions for alternate products.

It operates in two modes:

1. Automatic detection - Scans food shopping websites as you browse to identify products using structured data (JSON-LD), meta tags, and DOM analysis
2. Manual search - Search any food product through the popup to generate sustainability reports

### Tech Stack

EcoLens is built on React 19 + Typescript, Vite, Chrome Extensions Manifest V3 for the frontend, and FastAPI + SQLModel + MySQL for the backend

It uses the OpenFoodFacts API and database for the relevant sustainability data. Central foundation food data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) FoodData Central system is also used to recognize and index food items for algorithimic use.

The latest version of the extension can be found in the releases

1. **Setup environment**

    ```bash
    cd frontend/EcoLens
    npm install
    ```

2. **Configure API endpoint**

    ```bash
    # Create .env file
    echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env
    ```

3. **Build the extension**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Backend Setup

### Method 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

**Quick setup using Docker Compose - runs both API and database:**

1. **Clone and navigate to project**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Lifehack2025
    ```

2. **Start all backend services**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will:

    - Build and start the FastAPI backend on port 8000
    - Start MySQL database on port 3333
    - Create database and user automatically
    - Set up proper networking between services

3. **Verify services are running**

    ```bash
    # Check service status
    docker-compose ps

    # View logs
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```

4. **Test the API**

    - API: `http://localhost:8000`
    - API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

5. **Stop services when done**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Method 2: Local Development Setup

**Manual setup for development:**

1. **Setup Python environment**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    python -m venv ecolens-env
    source ecolens-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ecolens-env\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Setup MySQL database**

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE ecolens;
    CREATE USER 'ecolens'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ecolens.* TO 'ecolens'@'localhost';
    ```

3. **Configure environment**

    ```bash
    # Create .env file in backend directory
    echo "DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://ecolens:password@localhost:3306/ecolens" > .env
    ```

4. **Run the API server**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Full Stack Setup

**To run both frontend and backend together:**

1. **Start backend services**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. **Setup and build frontend**

    ```bash
    cd frontend/EcoLens

3. Click on the popup if it is a valid item. The extension will attempt to extract the name of the product automatically and ask for your confirmation
