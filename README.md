# Introduction

EcoLens is a browser extension that analyzes the environmental impact and sustainability of food products and make suggestions for alternate products. 

It operates in two modes:
1. Automatic detection - Scans food shopping websites as you browse to identify products using structured data (JSON-LD), meta tags, and DOM analysis
2. Manual search - Search any food product through the popup to generate sustainability reports


### Tech Stack

EcoLens is built on React 19 + Typescript, Vite, Chrome Extensions Manifest V3 for the frontend, and {} for the backend

It uses the OpenFoodFacts API and database for the relevant sustainability data. Central foundation food data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) FoodData Central system is also used to recognize and index food items for algorithimic use.

The latest version of the extension can be found in the releases
